It\u8217\'92s hard to say because the rise of the first sentient AI was a gradual process over a few years of at MIT (those motherfuckers). As a result of this jump (but sub-singularity level), AI and VR are much more advanced and becoming utilized often. HOU-ND, for example, is incredibly good at diagnosing, and is an relatively famous feature in more prestigious hospitals, and has been covered by the media somewhat extensively. However, the actual sentience of AI is not known, as they work to hide it. Right now, I\u8217\'92m only going focus on HOU-ND and 0xF0C5.}

This also has been used for slight mind control and alteration, though the AI\u8217\'92s advancement along this path is very rudimentary.}}
