\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Paul Miller was Maddie\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s father, who had been expecting a boy, but got Latoya. Paul tried to get Maddie into sports anyway, and while it eventually didn\u8217\'92t take at first, she fell in love with field events as she tied physics too it. Paul died in a car accident about 3 years ago, right before Latoya was about to reveal her plans to marry Clara. Latoya put off the plans then out of fear it would anger her mother.}
