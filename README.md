Hutia
=====

Hutia is a code name for a visual novel I was making for the [Strawberry
Jam](https://itch.io/jam/strawberry-jam) on itch.io, but didn’t come close to finishing in time. But
I’m still working on it! I’ll be using [Ink](http://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) as a scripting
language (with heavier parts likely written in C#), with graphics and sound handled by
[Unity](https://unity3d.com/).

The story will be about:
* Latoya, a coder
* Clara, her artsy roommate/girlfriend
* Ramsey, her business-minded coworker
* And 0xF0C5, the kitsune AI she created.

It will be a love story with sex scenes, involving furry transformation and mental changes.
I kind of hope to explore ideas of maintaining self-identity and independence in relationships.
But I mainly want outcomes decided through conversation and sexual
interplay.

I have commissioned [virtualysis](http://virtuarts.tumblr.com/) as an artist, and while they’re
still working on the art, what I’ve seen so far has been exciting!

I’ll be splitting time between both this and gemsbok, my VR project. Looking forward to it!
