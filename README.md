Hutia
=====

Hutia is a code name for a visual novel I’m making for the
[Strawberry Jam](https://itch.io/jam/strawberry-jam) on itch.io. I’ll be using
[Ink](http://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) as a scripting language (with heavier parts likely
written in C#), with graphics and sound handled by [Unity](https://unity3d.com/).

The story will be about:
* Latoya, a coder
* Clara, her artsy roommate/girlfriend
* Ramsey, her business-minded coworker
* And 0xF0C5, the Kitsune AI she created.

It will be a love story with sex scenes, involving furry transformation and mental changes.
I kind of hope to explore ideas of maintaining self-identity and independence in
relationships. I’m thinking of having some puzzles based on the infamous
[Knights and Knaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_and_Knaves) puzzles, but I’ve not
completely decided how. But I mainly want outcomes decided through conversation and sexual
interplay.

I may try to get an actual artist, and/or do some 3d modelling. I was thinking about using
the chance to learn [Live2D](http://www.live2d.com/en/) or
[Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com/).

I’ll be splitting time between both this and gemsbok, my VR project. Looking forward to it!
