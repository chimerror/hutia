Introduction
============

This document is an art guide for hutia, an erotic visual novel. It describes the general art
style and the specific art assets needed.

Elevator Pitch
==============

A programmer finds herself in a love quadrilateral between her girlfriend, her
manager, and the newly reality-bending AI she created.

Style Notes
===========

The style of the game (that is, fonts, colors, etc.) is meant to evoke the covers of the
O’Reilly “safari” series of books. To this end, use of color is very limited. Backgrounds tend
to be pure neutral colors like white. Character art is monochromatic line art with stippled
shading, meant to be a bit like engravings from old books. Brightly saturated colors serve
as accents and borders around UI elements and on characters, as well as representing the more
speculative and transformative elements of the game.

The body font is Rubik, a clean sans-serif meant to evoke Arial, though computer code is
written in Cutive Mono, a monospaced typewriter font. Headings are written in BioRhyme, a
thin slab serif.

Color Palette
=============

All RGB values are sRGB.

### Neutral Colors

Character colors cover the entire hue range, so the neutral colors are just very slightly
biased towards warm/cool. The end points are cool, while the grays are warm. The hope
is to give grays a little pop. I think there’s more than enough room to mess around or even
reverse this effect.

“Light Gray” (Light Grayish Yellow): 222, 222, 220 (#dededc)

her natural black straight back-length hair under an orange bandanna. She has one orange
highlighted bang that sticks out from under the bandanna. She prefers to wear overalls with
a work shirt and tends not to change her own style very much, saving her creative energies for
her work.

Clara’s Speedy Toy gazelle form is slightly puffed out inflatable pool-toy version of Clara as
an anthropomorphic gazelle. Her hands are hoof-like, and her head is like a toy version of a
gazelle’s head. She has a small tuft for a tail, and her horns are blunted. She has handles
along the side of her body, and a valve for her belly button. Her skin/casing is orange, as is
her hair, which still stretches to her back, but resembles bright doll hair.

### Physical Description

Ramsey is an athletic (though the coding world has put some weight on him), slightly above
average height mixed-race (of a Mexican Mestizo father, and an (Asian) Indian mother) man in
his mid 30s. He wears his dark brown hair in a neat quiff, and is usually clean shaven, though
he sometimes forgets to shave during crunch time. He normally wears a zip-up fleece (even in
summer time) and thin-rimmed glasses.

Ramsey’s plush ramtaur matches his human body (but slightly pudgier) from the waist up, but
his legs are replaced with the body of a big-horned sheep. His fur/outside is plush green.
He has an anthropomorphized ram’s head for his head. There is a sewn on tag with a heart near
his rump.

### Physical Description

Being an AI, their avatar and gender can be very fluid. They generally prefer to be a very
thin, long androgynous red fox anthro with purple fur, with a red fox’s normal black and white
markings. They have a long tube-like body, four arms ending in big toony paws wearing
fingerless toon gloves so their claws poke out. They have four very long thick bushy tails
they wrap themselves in like tentacles. The tails have a very ethereal look.
Their ears are huge for their head, and have bar piercings near the tips. Their head fur
resembles a messy bleached blond pixie cut, with additional long, straight black bangs
covering their eyes (though when excited, their eyes glow white through the bangs). They do
not have pupils or irises, the eyes are just purplish-white circles. On the right side of
their face, there’s an additional neon blue bang that stretches all the way down their face.
There is a rectangular black mark under their left eye. (This matches some dazzle camouflage
meant to prevent face recognition.)

Jake Bell
---------

### Art Needed

* Human base, sweatshirt and backwards baseball cap
* Two emotions
    * bored

### Physical Description

Jake is a white man in his early 20s of average height and build with messy brown hair.

HOU-ND
------

### Art Needed

* Humanoid AI base, lab coat, suit, glasses
* Two emotions for HOU-ND
    * dour/neutral

### Physical Description

HOU-ND is a sapient AI that was created for health diagnosis purposes. His avatar is a beefy
bedraggled bearded broad-chested white man with red hair in a relatively long cut like a
warrior. He wears a white lab coat above a dark green suit with a green tie and glasses that
often conceal his eyes. He has a cane he rests his beefy hands on as he speaks.
